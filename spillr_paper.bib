There are two main estimation strategies: modeling on the $\theta$ space, called ``$g$-modeling'' here, and modeling on the $x$ space, called ``$f$-modeling.'' The two approaches are described and compared. A series of computational formulas are developed to assess their frequentist accuracy. Several examples, both contrived and genuine, show the strengths and limitations of the two strategies.},

	abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.},

'Big data', 'data science', and 'machine learning' have become familiar terms in the news, as statistical methods are brought to bear upon the enormous data sets of modern science and commerce. How did we get here? And where are we going? This book takes us on an exhilarating journey through the revolution in data analysis following the introduction of electronic computation in the 1950s. Beginning with classical inferential theories - Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian - individual chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more. The distinctly modern approach integrates methodology and algorithms with statistical inference. The book ends with speculation on the future direction of statistics and data science.} }

This book offers a self-contained and concise introduction to causal models and how to learn them from data. After explaining the need for causal models and discussing some of the principles underlying causal inference, the book teaches readers how to use causal models: how to compute intervention distributions, how to infer causal models from observational and interventional data, and how causal ideas could be exploited for classical machine learning problems. All of these topics are discussed first in terms of two variables and then in the more general multivariate case. The bivariate case turns out to be a particularly hard problem for causal learning because there are no conditional independences as used by classical methods for solving multivariate cases. The authors consider analyzing statistical asymmetries between cause and effect to be highly instructive, and they report on their decade of intensive research into this problem.},

The many available enriched stable isotopes of the transition elements can provide up to 100 distinguishable reporting tags, which can be measured simultaneously because of the essential independence of detection provided by the mass spectrometer. We discuss the adaptation of traditional inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to cytometry applications. We focus on the generation of cytometry-compatible data and on approaches to unsupervised multivariate clustering analysis. Finally, we provide a high-level review of some recent benchmark reports that highlight the potential for massively multi-parameter mass cytometry.},

Mass spectrometry is the most powerful method for protein analysis, but its application to single cells faces three major challenges: efficiently delivering proteins/peptides to mass spectrometry detectors, identifying their sequences, and scaling the analysis to many thousands of single cells. These challenges have motivated corresponding solutions, including SCoPE design multiplexing and clean, automated, and miniaturized sample preparation. Synergistically applied, these solutions enable quantifying thousands of proteins across many single cells and establish a solid foundation for further advances. Building upon this foundation, the SCoPE concept will enable analyzing subcellular organelles and posttranslational modifications, while increases in multiplexing capabilities will increase the throughput and decrease cost.},

	abstract = {Ofatumumab is the first, fully human, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in Phase 3 development for multiple sclerosis (MS). The study focused on changes in lymphocyte subsets in blood and lymphoid tissues and on potential novel biomarkers as a result of anti-CD20 antibody action in Cynomolgus monkeys treated with human equivalent doses of subcutaneous (s.c.) ofatumumab on Days 0, 7, and 14. Axillary lymph nodes (LNs) and blood samples were collected at various time points until Day 90. Lymphocyte subsets were quantified by flow cytometry, while morphological and immune cell changes were assessed by imaging mass cytometry (IMC), immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and transcriptome analyses using single-cell methodology. Ofatumumab treatment resulted in a potent and rapid reduction of B cells along with a simultaneous drop in CD20<sup>+</sup> T cell counts. At Day 21, IHC revealed B-cell depletion in the perifollicular and interfollicular area of axillary LNs, while only the core of the germinal center was depleted of CD20<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>+</sup> cells. By Day 62, the perifollicular and interfollicular areas were abundantly infiltrated by CD21<sup>+</sup> B cells and this distribution returned to the baseline cytoarchitecture by Day 90. By IMC CD20<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cells could be identified at the margin of the follicles, with a similar pattern of distribution at Day 21 and 90. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis showed that ofatumumab induced reversible changes in t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) defined B-cell subsets that may serve as biomarkers for drug action. In summary, low dose s.c. ofatumumab potently depletes both B cells and CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells but apparently spares marginal zone (MZ) B cells in the spleen and LN. These findings add to our molecular and tissue-architectural understanding of ofatumumab treatment effects on B-cell subsets.},

It is an open question of which is the most appropriate discrete distribution, not only in terms of model estimation, but also regarding interpretability, complexity and biological plausibility of inherent assumptions. To address the question of interpretability, we investigate mechanistic transcription and degradation models underlying commonly used discrete probability distributions. Known bottom-up approaches infer steady-state probability distributions such as Poisson or Poisson-beta distributions from different underlying transcription-degradation models. By turning this procedure upside down, we show how to infer a corresponding biological model from a given probability distribution, here the negative binomial distribution. Realistic mechanistic models underlying this distributional assumption are unknown so far. Our results indicate that the negative binomial distribution arises as steady-state distribution from a mechanistic model that produces mRNA molecules in bursts. We empirically show that it provides a convenient trade-off between computational complexity and biological simplicity.},

For differential expression analysis in multi-subject single-cell data, negative binomial mixed models account for both subject-level and cell-level overdispersions, but are computationally demanding. Here, we propose an efficient NEgative Binomial mixed model Using a Large-sample Approximation (NEBULA). The speed gain is achieved by analytically solving high-dimensional integrals instead of using the Laplace approximation. We demonstrate that NEBULA is orders of magnitude faster than existing tools and controls false-positive errors in marker gene identification and co-expression analysis. Using NEBULA in Alzheimer's disease cohort data sets, we found that the cell-level expression of APOE correlated with that of other genetic risk factors (including CLU, CST3, TREM2, C1q, and ITM2B) in a cell-type-specific pattern and an isoform-dependent manner in microglia. NEBULA opens up a new avenue for the broad application of mixed models to large-scale multi-subject single-cell data.},

Even the advent of spectral cytometry cannot circumvent the spillover problem, with spectral unmixing an intrinsic part of such systems. The calculation of spillover coefficients from single-color controls has remained essentially unchanged since its inception, and is increasingly limited in its ability to deal with high-parameter flow cytometry. Here, we present AutoSpill, an alternative method for calculating spillover coefficients. The approach combines automated gating of cells, calculation of an initial spillover matrix based on robust linear regression, and iterative refinement to reduce error. Moreover, autofluorescence can be compensated out, by processing it as an endogenous dye in an unstained control. AutoSpill uses single-color controls and is compatible with common flow cytometry software. AutoSpill allows simpler and more robust workflows, while reducing the magnitude of compensation errors in high-parameter flow cytometry.},

@article{cytospill,
	abstract = {Abstract Signal intensity measured in a mass cytometry (CyTOF) channel can often be affected by the neighboring channels due to technological limitations. Such signal artifacts are known as spillover effects and can substantially limit the accuracy of cell population clustering. Current approaches reduce these effects by using additional beads for normalization purposes known as single-stained controls. While effective in compensating for spillover effects, incorporating single-stained controls can be costly and require customized panel design. This is especially evident when executing large-scale immune profiling studies. We present a novel statistical method, named CytoSpill that independently quantifies and compensates the spillover effects in CyTOF data without requiring the use of single-stained controls. Our method utilizes knowledge-guided modeling and statistical techniques, such as finite mixture modeling and sequential quadratic programming, to achieve optimal error correction. We evaluated our method using five publicly available CyTOF datasets obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow, healthy human bone marrow, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient, and healthy human cord blood samples. In the PBMCs with known ground truth, our method achieved comparable results to experiments that incorporated single-stained controls. In datasets without ground-truth, our method not only reduced spillover on likely affected markers, but also led to the discovery of potentially novel subpopulations expressing functionally meaningful, cluster-specific markers. CytoSpill (developed in R) will greatly enhance the execution of large-scale cellular profiling of tumor immune microenvironment, development of novel immunotherapy, and the discovery of immune-specific biomarkers. The implementation of our method can be found at https://github.com/KChen-lab/CytoSpill.git.},

@article{multi-block,
	abstract = {{Motivation: Eukaryotic gene expression (GE) is subjected to precisely coordinated multi-layer controls, across the levels of epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Recently, the emerging multi-dimensional genomic dataset has provided unprecedented opportunities to study the cross-layer regulatory interplay. In these datasets, the same set of samples is profiled on several layers of genomic activities, e.g. copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation (DM), GE and microRNA expression (ME). However, suitable analysis methods for such data are currently sparse.Results: In this article, we introduced a sparse Multi-Block Partial Least Squares (sMBPLS) regression method to identify multi-dimensional regulatory modules from this new type of data. A multi-dimensional regulatory module contains sets of regulatory factors from different layers that are likely to jointly contribute to a local `gene expression factory'. We demonstrated the performance of our method on the simulated data as well as on The Cancer Genomic Atlas Ovarian Cancer datasets including the CNV, DM, ME and GE data measured on 230 samples. We showed that majority of identified modules have significant functional and transcriptional enrichment, higher than that observed in modules identified using only a single type of genomic data. Our network analysis of the modules revealed that the CNV, DM and microRNA can have coupled impact on expression of important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.Availability and implementation: The source code implemented by MATLAB is freely available at: http://zhoulab.usc.edu/sMBPLS/.Contact:  xjzhou@usc.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary material are available at Bioinformatics online.}},
